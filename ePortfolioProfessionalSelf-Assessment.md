CS 499 Capstone

Completing the Computer Science program and building this ePortfolio has been a transformative journey that helped me discover and strengthen 
my identity as a software developer. Throughout the program, I tackled real-world problems, built complete systems, and continuously improved 
both my technical and professional skills. This ePortfolio brings those experiences together to show the value I can offer as a full-time 
developer.

Over the course of the program, I’ve developed hands-on experience with multiple languages, frameworks, and tools. I’ve built everything from 
embedded Python applications to full stack web platforms. The capstone project helped refine my ability to enhance existing systems with modular 
design, testing, and integration. I also learned to document my process clearly and think critically about the quality and scalability of my 
solutions.

I gained experience working in collaborative environments using Git, peer reviews, and agile practices. These team-based projects taught me to 
write clean, maintainable code and communicate effectively with teammates. In addition, I learned to present technical ideas to non-technical 
stakeholders through written reports and interface mockups—skills that are essential in today’s software development roles.

DSA were used practical algorithmic thinking to build search features, logic controllers, and performance improvements
across multiple projects. For software engineering & databases I created desktop and web applications using Java, Python, JavaScript, Node.js, 
MongoDB, and SQL. Applied structured design and testing principles throughout. For security awareness I applied secure coding practices such as 
input validation, error handling, and minimizing attack surfaces in both client and server logic.

The artifacts in this portfolio showcase my full range of software development skills. Thermostat System: Built in Python on a Raspberry Pi 
with real-time I²C sensors, LED indicators, and SQLite logging. Demonstrates hardware/software integration and embedded systems knowledge. 
ABCU Banking System is A Java Swing-based desktop app with account management, modular design, and GUI refinement. Highlights my structured
programming and software lifecycle experience. Developed with the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js). Includes REST APIs, 
filtered search, and dynamic UI components. Showcases full stack design, routing, and component-based architecture.

This ePortfolio reflects the depth of my technical skills and the growth I’ve made through real projects. I’m passionate about writing clean, 
functional code and contributing to development teams that solve real problems. As I transition into the professional world, I’m excited to 
bring my skills, focus, and drive into a full-time software development role.
